# Once Upon a Player (OUP)
This is my favorite project that I have designed and developed while learning Unity.
This has been a solo project and game has been designed by me inspired by numerous different games and ideas. Coding and interactions and API and database design and architecture by me.
This is a game with lots of fun features by Avi.
